## Introduction

Welcome to the **Mancala** repository! In this project, I have implemented a playable version of the classic African stone game, Mancala. This game allows a user to challenge a computer opponent, either a "Smart Player" or "Bad Player". There is also an option for 2 users to play the classic Mancala.

## Features

List the main features of your project.

- User vs. Smart Player: A user plays against the Smart Player. A Smart Player chooses moves by recursively searching game trees to strategize and determine optimal moves
- User vs. Bad Player: A user plays against the Bad Player. A Bad Player chooses moves randomly
- User vs. User (Classic Mancala): 2 users play against each other

## Installation

Step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up the project.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repo`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Configuration steps, if any.

## Usage

Once you have the project opened, navigate to the file Main.cpp. Depending on what type of opponent you would like to play against, only ONE of the following lines should be uncommented a once: line 18, line 19, or line 20. Here, you have the choice of whether you want to play against a 1) Smart Player, 2) Bad Player, or 3) Human.

You do not need to edit anything else. All that is left to do is open up a new terminal, run the code, and have fun!
